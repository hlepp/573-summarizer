After a week of steadily increasing seismic rumbling, Mount St. Helens on Friday burped a tall column of steam and ash that officials said was probably not a precursor to a large sustained eruption from the most active volcano on the West Coast.
The volcano is being closely monitored in part because of its cataclysmic explosion in 1980.
The explosion killed 57 people, triggered the largest landslide in recorded history and blew 520 million tons of ash eastward across the United States.
No injuries or damage to property were reported.
Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
