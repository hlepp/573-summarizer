Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
Through their lawyers, the officers have said they thought Diallo had a gun.
``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe ``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was shot after he had fallen.
